Yield variability across agricultural regions poses challenges to index insurance by introducing basis risk, often inadequately addressed by using traditional administrative boundaries as Unit Areas of Insurance (UAI). This study builds on existing research to propose more homogeneous, agroecologically defined UAIs, hypothesizing that these will improve yield predictability and reduce index insurance basis risks. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of refined UAIs in capturing yield variability more accurately, thereby reducing basis risk for index insurance. We first identified key variables, including satellite-based vegetation indices and climate data, to assess their ability to capture maize yield variability in maize growing areas in Kenya. K-means clustering was then applied to delineate and refine homogeneous UAIs based on these variables, enhancing spatial accuracy and yield uniformity within each zone. We found that our approach to defined UAIs slightly outperform administrative boundaries in yield predictability, from $R^2$ of 67\% to 72\% and RMSE of 0.24mt/ha to 0.14mt/ha indicating stronger model accuracy. These findings demonstrate that refined UAIs reduce basis risk in index insurance, with practical implications for insurance providers and policymakers.
